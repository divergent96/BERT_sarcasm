# Sarcasm detection in Twitter posts

I started working on this project while I was pursuing my M.Sc. in Applied modeling at Trent University. This project is my first deep dive into working with PyTorch, tuning deep learning models and learning more about text mining and sentiment analysis by fusing different models and feature sets extracted from Twitter posts. 

## Primary objective
1. Study existing research on application of deep learning models for text analysis, with focus on identifying the sentiment of text.
1. Learn and implement various methods for preprocessing and cleaning text data.
1. Test various forms of word embeddings and study the effect on the model accuracy. 
1. Perform sentiment analysis on text data, and extract features helpful in identifying sarcasm.
1. Utilize pre-trained BERT model (huggingface.io) to generate meaningful word embeddings from text data, and compare output to traditional methods.
1. Test a framework utilizing outputs from a simple model with minimal features (text length, sentiment score, etc) along with word embeddings to improve test score of final deep learning model.
